# Zeta
This project gets it name from Zeta Halo, the ring where Halo Infinite takes place.

## Features
**Note: Zeta's aims to reintroduce missing features into Halo Infinite.**
1. Use a specific display mode/display resolution of your choice with a specific windowed program for better performance.
2. Override a program's borderless window implementation with a statically sized borderless window.
3. Automatically minimize a borderless window when its not the foreground window for better multitasking.

To to use a specific display mode/resolution, simply change the window size option within Halo Infinite video's settings & restart the game.
